This single player Tictactoe game uses a minimax algorithm to choose the optimal move each round. It works by simulating all of the best moves to make in order to maximize or minimize the score. Becasue of this, it is imposible to win against, and if you are playing optimally, the best you can do it tie.


## Lessons Learned

In order to make this I had to learn the minimax algorithm and then firgure out had to implement it in a practical way. I also learned a lot about pygame and how to implement game logic.
